# NOW: #02 - Balance

This work was inspired by the Yin-Yang philosophy and the art of my friend Panos Dimitropoulos. The Yin-Yang symbol, with its representation of balance between light and dark, serves as a metaphor for this timepiece. Here, Yin-Yang symbolizes time, reflecting the illusion of balance that time can project.

Time, much like the universe and its objects, is in constant flux. True balance, where everything is static and unchanging, equates to lifelessnessâ€”an impossible state in our ever-dynamic world.This timepiece captures the transient nature of balance, suggesting that perfect equilibrium exists solely in the present moment Each moment is unique and embodies its own form of balance, regardless of past or future states.

In "Balance," the watch face uses the rotation and interplay of light and dark within the Yin-Yang symbol to indicate hours and minutes. This design highlights that though complete balance is elusive, each moment can manifest a perfect balance in its own right. It encourages viewers to value the fleeting harmony within each passing second.
