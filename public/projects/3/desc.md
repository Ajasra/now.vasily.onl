# NOW: #03 - Sagacity

This timepiece explores the subjective nature of time perception, showing how our attention and engagement influence how fast time seems to pass. The concept behind this watch is rooted in the different experiences of time we have during various activities.

"Sagacity" visually represents this phenomenon by adjusting the speed at which time is displayed based on how often you check it. The more frequently you check the watch, the slower time moves, indicating that you're likely disengaged from the present moment and wanting it to pass. Conversely, if you rarely check the time, it speeds up, suggesting you are fully immersed in your activities and losing track of time.

This piece challenges viewers to reflect on their relationship with time and presence. It highlights how our perception of time's passage is intricately tied to our engagement with life. By visualizing this concept, "Sagacity" invites us to become more aware of how we spend our moments and encourages us to seek deeper presence in our daily lives.
